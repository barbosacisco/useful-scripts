# Code for Problem Solving

## 📌 Purpose

This repository exists to demonstrate my understanding of programming concepts through short, simple programs. These examples focus on core ideas rather than language-specific syntax and include:

- Variables
- Lists
- Loops
- Operators
- Conditional statements (`if`)
- Functions
- Automation scripts 

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Write clean and readable code
- Follow Python's best practices and style guidelines
- Express strong programming fundamentals in a simple, clear way

---

## 🤔 Why simple programs?

Because I’m always learning — and the main focus is on solving problems.  
The language (Python, in this case) is just a tool. These foundational concepts can be applied across many languages to create useful software and solutions.

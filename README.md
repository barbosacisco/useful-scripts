# Useful Scripts

A personal collection of Bash and Python scripts for server management, automation, and basic programming practice.

## Project Overview

This repository contains various useful scripts organized by language and topic.

- **bash-scripts/**  
  Bash scripts focused on automating server management tasks such as backups, service monitoring, and system updates.

- **python-scripts/**  
  Python scripts organized by programming concepts (functions, loops, conditionals, etc.) and practical server management examples.

## Usage

Each script is self-contained and can be run individually.  
Make sure you have the necessary permissions before executing server management scripts.

```

Example to run a Python script:
```bash
python3 path/to/your/script.py
```

## Requirements

- Bash 5.0+
- Python 3.8+
